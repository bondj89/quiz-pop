## Introduction 
For my personal android project, I chose to create an app called QuizPop. 
The app is simple and will consist of multiple choice, true or false type 
questions of general trivia knowledge. 


## Description 
Developed in Android, QuizPop is an all you can play trivia game that 
allows players to answer questions from their favorite topics. 
Players can choose questions in the format of multiple choice and true or false. 
Players can choose the difficulty level and compete against their 
friends by signing in. 

## Intended Users 
Anyone that loves to play trivia from the palm of their hands. 
This app should appeal to people of all ages who enjoy trivia related activities, 
flexing their brain and competing with friends.
