## Introduction 
For this android project, I chose to create a trivia app called Quiz Pop. Since this 
is my first time every building an app, I wanted it to be a challenging but fun experience. 
My trivia app is simple and consists of multiple choice, true or false type questions of general 
trivia knowledge. 

## Description 
Developed in Android, Quiz Pop is an all you can play trivia game 
that allows players to answer questions from many different popular topics. 
Questions are in the format of multiple choice and true or false. Questions will 
appear on screen and the answers will highlight green once you select your choice. 
Once the user hits the "Next" button at the bottom of the screen, a new question will 
appear for your chance to tackle the next question. 

## Intended Users 
Anyone that loves to play trivia from the palm of their hands. 
This app should appeal to people of all ages who enjoy trivia 
related activities, flexing their brain and competing with friends.
